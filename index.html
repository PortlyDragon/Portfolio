        </div>
        <p class="outset">
            I have created a system that would take multiple pre created buildings and randomize the buildings and also the objects inside
            making multiple buildings all different from each other for everytime the player presses play
        </p>
        <h3>Rope Bridges</h3>

            <img src="Images/RopeBridge.gif" width="500" height="300" />
        </div>
        <p class="outset">
            Created a dynamic Rope bridges that can be interacte by the action of the player and enemies, player can walk and jump interacting with
            the bridges physics as well as destroy it on any of its different parts, the enemies can do this things as well
        </p>

            <img src="Images/TeleportingEnemy.gif" width="500" height="300" />
        </div>
        <p class="outset">
            Created an enemy that will teleport to the player location and attack, the teleporting locattion depend on if the player is close
            or far away from the enemy, enemy will also go back to roaming mod if the player manage to get out of its range before his teleporttation
            cooldown resets

        <h3>Speed bar</h3>
        <div>
            <img src="Images/SpeedBar.gif" width="500" height="300" border=1 />
        </div>
        <p class="outset">
            I created a system that would check the player speed and it would diminish as the player fires its weapon or if the player wasnt moving fast enough.
            If the player reached a high speed, the bar would fill up, depending on how full the speed bar was the weopon would fire different types of bullets.
        </p>
        <h3>Main weapon</h3>
        <div> <img src="Images/Weapon.png" width="500" height="300" border=1 /></div>
        <p class="outset">
            The main weapon of EveilEcounters is a double barrel gun, one side its a shotgun that main porpuse is to launch the player, the second weapon is like a DMR
            a single fire weapon that can do more damage, the weapon works by pressing the left mouse to fire the shotgun, and right mouse click to fire the DMR
        </p>
        <h3>shotgun Launch</h3>
        <div> <img src="Images/ShotgunJump.gif" width="500" height="300" border=1 /></div>
        <p class="outset">
            I create a shotgun weapon that had low damage to enemies but it could lauch the player on the oposite direction that the player was looking as they shoot
            the weopon, this allows the players to gain more speed and fill their speed bar.
        </p>
        <h3>DMR</h3>
        <div> <img src="Images/Typeofbullets.gif" width="500" height="300" border=1 /></div>
        <p class="outset">
            Created a DMR type of weapon, this weapons uses the speed bar to fire diffent types of bullets, if the player has speed bar at less than 50% it would fire a weak shot,
            but if the player has a speed bar more than 75% they would acquired the most powerful type of shot.
        </p>
